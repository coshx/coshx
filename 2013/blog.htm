						<h3>Background</h3>				
						<p>The idea of <a href="#">GigDog</a> is simple: we want to get more people going to local concerts by making it easy to learn the songs of bands that have upcoming shows. Implicit in this idea, however, are a few assumptions that deserve to be tested:</p>

Still, it will be worth testing how well popularity on GigDog can influence ticket sales once the site itself is more popular. Similarly, the second point is almost tautological, since we learn music by listening to it. It's worth stating this assumption, however, because it may be important to measure how well our platform allows listeners to learn the music.</p>
