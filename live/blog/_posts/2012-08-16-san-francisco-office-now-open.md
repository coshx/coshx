I'm happy to announce our new permanent office in San Francisco, as well as our first San Francisco hire, Michael Makarov.
   

San Francisco is the third Coshx office after Boulder and Charlottesville.  And Michael's joining brings our headcount to 12, including our staff members in Austin, Baltimore, and Belgrade.
   

In addition to Michael and myself, we're pleased to share our space with Stewie the Dog.
   

As well as working together at Coshx Labs, Michael and I organize and teach the weekly [Rails class](https://www.noisebridge.net/wiki/Backend_web_dev_in_Ruby_on_Rails) at the neighborhood hackerspace, [Noisebridge](https://www.noisebridge.net).
   

We look forward to much productive collaboration with more brilliant hires and clients in San Francisco.  To get started, visit us in SoMa at [1211 Folsom St. (at 8th)](http://goo.gl/maps/eiNlT), on the 3rd  floor, or reach me at [gabe@coshx.com](gabe@coshx.com).
