This was a really fun week at Coshx. Not only did we get to celebrate launching this new version of our site, but we also finished the week with a 48-hour hackathon.

Over the next week, some awesome community members are going to use [one of the projects](http://hackathons.coshx.com) to give us honest feedback about our ideas, code, development strategies, or whatever else they feel like reviewing. They'll also be choosing which projects receive awards.

We'd love to hear your thoughts in the comments section.
