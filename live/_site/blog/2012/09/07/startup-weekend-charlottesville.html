<p><strong>Edit</strong> (<em>Ben</em>): I found this unpublished post that Dave wrote right after the previous Charlottesville Startup Weekend, and it's getting me really excited both about mentoring this weekend at <a href="http://rva.startupweekend.org">Richmond Startup Weekend</a> (at the time of writing this, there are still tickets left for Designers and Developers on the <a href="http://swrva.eventbrite.com/">Eventbrite page</a>) and for the next <a href="http://charlottesville.startupweekend.org/">Charlottesville Startup Weekend</a> which is right around the corner.</p>

<p>How much can you accomplish in 54 hours? Odds are you can get a lot done - especially when you're collaborating with a group eager to crank out a full prototype in just a couple days. It's a blast and I encourage you to check out <a href="http://startupweekend.org/">their site</a> and think about going.</p>

<p>So what's fun about it? Why would you give up a weekend to do something like this? First off, the community. It's a chance to schmooze and network, sure, but it's also a chance to band together with some like-minded folks and hammer out a project. You don't have time to do everything. You have to make compromises. But in the end you'll come out having learned a lot about something (what that something is will vary widely, and that's part of the fun) and you might even have something awesome to show for it.</p>

<p>So what did I do? I halfheartedly proposed something (and actually got some interest), but I ended up working with a group of nearly a dozen people on a mobile Facebook app that tries to turn social interactions and interests into a market simulation game. Sounds terribly startupy, right? That's the point! Try something quirky and run with it. We pivoted a little (WELL HELLO THAR BUZZWORD) but came away generally satisfied that we had an interesting idea.</p>

<p>Is it The Next Big Thing? Not yet. Did anyone make that mythical unicorn-like capital magnet of a viral product that all startups yearn to spin into the unsuspecting market? It's too soon to say - overnight success never really happens overnight.</p>
