<p><code>||</code> and <code>&amp;&amp;</code> bind with the precedence that you expect from boolean operators in programming languages (<code>&amp;&amp;</code> is very strong, <code>||</code> is slightly less strong).</p>

<p><code>and</code> and <code>or</code> have lower precedence.</p>

<p>For example, unlike <code>||</code>,  <code>or</code> has lower precedence than <code>=</code>:</p>

<p>```ruby</p>

<blockquote><p>a = false || true
 => true
a
 => true
a = false or true
 => true
a
 => false
```</p></blockquote>

<p>Likewise, unlike <code>&amp;&amp;</code>, <code>and</code> also has lower precedence than <code>=</code>:</p>

<p>```ruby</p>

<blockquote><p>a = true &amp;&amp; false
 => false
a
 => false
a = true and false
 => false
a
 => true
```</p></blockquote>

<p>What's more, unlike <code>&amp;&amp;</code> and <code>||</code>, <code>and</code> and <code>or</code> bind with equal precedence.</p>

<p>Notice that because <code>&amp;&amp;</code> is higher precedence than <code>||</code>, the 2nd and 3rd clause are bound together, so there's no need to evaluate either of them once the 1st clause evaluates true:</p>

<p>```ruby</p>

<blockquote><p>!puts(1) || !puts(2) &amp;&amp; !puts(3)
1
 => true
```</p></blockquote>

<p>But since <code>or</code> and <code>and</code> have equal precedence, the left-most <code>and</code> or <code>or</code> operator has higher precedence.  In this case the <code>or</code> is left-most so it binds the 1st and 2nd clauses together.  Because the second operator is an <code>and</code>, the 3rd clause must be evaluated to resolve the expression:</p>

<p>```ruby</p>

<blockquote><p>!puts(1) or !puts(2) and !puts(3)
1
3
 => true
```</p></blockquote>

<p>Observe that the parentheses force the <code>and</code> to bind the 2nd and 3rd clauses together, just as if it were a <code>&amp;&amp;</code>:</p>

<p>```ruby</p>

<blockquote><p>!puts(1) or (!puts(2) and !puts(3))
1
 => true
```</p></blockquote>

<p>The weakly-binding <code>and</code> and <code>or</code> may be useful for control-flow purposes: see <a href="http://devblog.avdi.org/2010/08/02/using-and-and-or-in-ruby/">Using "and" and "or" in Ruby</a>.</p>
