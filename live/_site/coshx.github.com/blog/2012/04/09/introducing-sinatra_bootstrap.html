<p><a href="http://www.sinatrarb.com/">Sinatra</a> is a great way to quickly prototype
an idea or build one-off projects with minimum fuss. The only problem
I've ever encountered is remembering the exact format needed for your
application to get that initial push off the ground.</p>

<p>To solve that problem, I've thrown together <a href="https://github.com/rahearn/sinatra_bootstrap">sinatra_bootstrap</a>;
a quick and easy generator for those first few lines of code needed to get your idea out of your head and onto a
server.</p>

<p>There are three distinct types of output that sinatra_bootstrap can
generate.</p>

<h2>Bare Bones</h2>

<pre><code>$ take_the_stage sinatra
</code></pre>

<p>Generates a <code>Gemfile</code> (containing only <code>sinatra</code>), and a <code>main.rb</code> file
with a sample <code>get '/'</code> block.</p>

<h2>Rack Application</h2>

<pre><code>$ take_the_stage sinatra --rackup
</code></pre>

<p>Same as the bare bones option, but now a <code>config.ru</code> file is generated,
making this option perfect for people who develop with a rack server
such as <a href="http://pow.cx">pow</a>.</p>

<h2>Heroku-Ready</h2>

<pre><code>$ take_the_stage heroku
</code></pre>

<p><code>main.rb</code> and <code>config.ru</code> are the same as the last output, but running
with the heroku option inclues thin, heroku, and foreman in the
<code>Gemfile</code> as well as creating a <code>Procfile</code> suitable for deployment onto
Heroku's cedar stack.</p>

<p>The output is purposefully simple, in line with sinatra's great strength
of being a beautifully simple and clean framework for getting things
done. There are other frameworks out there that do a great job of
setting up enough libraries to turn sinatra into a rails deployment.</p>
