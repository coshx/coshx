<p>I'm happy to announce our new permanent office in San Francisco, as well as our first San Francisco hire, Michael Makarov.</p>

<p>San Francisco is the third Coshx office after Boulder and Charlottesville.  And Michael's joining brings our headcount to 12, including our staff members in Austin, Baltimore, and Belgrade.</p>

<p>In addition to Michael and myself, we're pleased to share our space with Stewie the Dog.</p>

<p>As well as working together at Coshx Labs, Michael and I organize and teach the weekly <a href="https://www.noisebridge.net/wiki/Backend_web_dev_in_Ruby_on_Rails">Rails class</a> at the neighborhood hackerspace, <a href="https://www.noisebridge.net">Noisebridge</a>.</p>

<p>We look forward to much productive collaboration with more brilliant hires and clients in San Francisco.  To get started, visit us in SoMa at <a href="http://goo.gl/maps/eiNlT">1211 Folsom St. (at 8th)</a>, on the 3rd  floor, or reach me at <a href="gabe@coshx.com">gabe@coshx.com</a>.</p>
